## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"battery": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"temperature": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Water leak alarm 1 (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected a water leak (alarm_1).
Value can be found in the published state on the `water_leak_alarm_1` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` water leak alarm 1 is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Water leak alarm 2 (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected a water leak (alarm_2).
Value can be found in the published state on the `water_leak_alarm_2` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` water leak alarm 2 is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery low (binary)
Indicates whether the battery of the device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Warning (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"warning": {"mode": VALUE, "level": VALUE, "strobe_level": VALUE, "strobe": VALUE, "strobe_duty_cycle": VALUE, "duration": VALUE}}`
- `mode` (enum): Mode of the warning (sound effect) allowed values: `stop`, `burglar`, `fire`, `emergency`, `police_panic`, `fire_panic`, `emergency_panic`
- `level` (enum): Sound level allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`
- `strobe_level` (enum): Intensity of the strobe allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`
- `strobe` (binary): Turn on/off the strobe (light) during warning allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `strobe_duty_cycle` (numeric): Length of the flash cycle max value is 10
- `duration` (numeric): Duration in seconds of the alarm unit is s
